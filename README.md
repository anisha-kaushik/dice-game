#### Program Flow
This is a single player game where user has 10 turns to roll 5 dices. The program accepts user’s name.

User name input constraints: the name cannot contain any special characters

After entering name, the game will start with 0 points. As the user rolls dice for each turn, following outcomes might happen:

1. If the sum of 5 dice is a prime number, they will receive 50 points
2. If all the numbers rolled are different then user will receive 25 points
3. If one or more numbers are same then they will receive 30 points
4. If the sum of all dice rolled is not a prime number, then user will be allowed to roll each dice individually

After 10 turns, the game ends and user will be provided a final score of their 10 turns.
